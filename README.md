# ASCII Art Generator

## Overview
The ASCII Art Generator is a Python-based application that converts images into visually stunning ASCII art. This tool processes an image file and transforms it into a textual representation using ASCII characters. It is ideal for creating creative artwork or adding unique touches to projects.

---

## Prerequisites
To use this application, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.6 or later**: Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Pillow Library**: This is a Python library for image processing. Install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install pillow
  ```
- **An Image File**: The image can be in formats such as `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg`.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Confused-coder1919/ascii-art-generator--Syed-Mohammad-Shah-Mostafa---TD-n-1-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ascii-art-generator--Syed-Mohammad-Shah-Mostafa---TD-n-1-
   ```
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

## How to Run the Application
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ascii-art-generator--Syed-Mohammad-Shah-Mostafa---TD-n-1-
   ```
2. Run the script with the image file path as an argument:
   ```bash
   python3 ascii_art_generator.py <path_to_image>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   python3 ascii_art_generator.py /Users/username/Downloads/photo.jpg
   ```

---

## How to Use the Application
1. **Provide the Image Path:**
   - Specify the full path to the image file you want to convert.
   - Ensure the file exists and is accessible.

2. **View the Output:**
   - The ASCII art will be displayed directly in the terminal.
   - Additionally, the output will be saved in a file named `ascii_art_output.txt` in the same directory as the script.

3. **Customize the Output (Optional):**
   - Modify the `new_width` variable in the script to change the size of the ASCII art.
   - For advanced usage, you can tweak the ASCII character set or other parameters.

## Example Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python3 ascii_art_generator.py /Users/username/Downloads/sample.jpg
   ```
2. View the ASCII art directly in the terminal or in the `ascii_art_output.txt` file.
